# Gender Prediction
Dataset is provided in text file for each state.Using these files new Dataset is created with more than 10 million names of males and females bewtween 1910 and 2020.

In this project, aim was to predict gender of a person by using their name only. For instance, 10 names are provided to user and machine, these names are selected randomly by algorithm.Now you can select your answers based on your wits and Mahine will use Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the gender. Finally we get a winner.

I have added detailed explanation for the name in this [notebook](gender_prediction.ipynb)
